# sales_predictions

## Overview
The Sales Predictions project is my first exploration into data science. I was given a data set of product charactaristics and sales in a number out outlets. The goal was to create a prediction method for future sales. 
The concept of future sales was not difined and given my interest in product development and industrial design i chose to use this as an opportunity to explore new market opportunities as well the concept of canabalism of sales. 
In the end my goal was to develop a ML model that would help the companies staff identify new products and predict their sales potential based on known charactaristics of any product.
