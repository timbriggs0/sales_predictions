# sales_predictions
For this projet I was given the 'Sales Data' for a supermarkt chain and asked to clean/analyze/predict sales on new products that might be brought into the store.
Durring this project I used many tools through the python language namely Pandas, MatPlotLib, Bokeh, and SKLearn.

As I finish this project you can find the most up to date and a more indepth description in the index.html file in this Rpo, I will work on finishing the ReadMe with a complete overview of the project and outcome.

you can see a scroll through of the index.html here (Index_html.mkv)
